# Goat Framework

Goat is a Java framework for building distributed systems with a focus on reliability, scalability, and maintainability. It provides a set of abstractions and components that make it easier to build complex distributed applications.

## Core Features

### Identity Generation
- Snowflake-based ID generation for distributed systems
- Support for multiple devices with unique device IDs
- High-performance, collision-free ID generation

### Component Lifecycle Management
- Standardized lifecycle for all components (start, stop, pause, resume, destroy)
- Abstract implementation with hooks for customization
- Thread-safe state transitions

### Task Processing
- Task-based execution model with success tracking
- Support for rollback operations
- Pre-processing and post-processing hooks
- Chainable tasks for complex workflows

### Worker Model
- Worker abstraction for background processing
- Queue-based dispatch workers for asynchronous processing
- Lifecycle management for workers

### Messaging System
- Postal system metaphor for message passing
- Support for direct, group, and broadcast messaging
- Secure message signing and verification
- Mailbox abstraction for message reception

### Platform Abstraction
- Abstract platform for building distributed systems
- Identity-based platform instances
- Extensible design for custom platforms
